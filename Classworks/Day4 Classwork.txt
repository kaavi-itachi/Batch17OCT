GCC: 
	• GNU project c and c++ compiler
	• When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking
	• If we use -g the size of the application increase.
	• -> GCC commands (learn- -c,-s,-e,-g,-pg,-warn,-Idir,-ldir,-Dmacro,-foption,….)
	• -ansi: to meet standards
	• -std-mentions which standard or version I'll be using.
	• -I : to include a particular directory(third party files)
	• -c : compiles, -E : preprocessed state
	• Gcc -Wall -c main.c - to compile
	• Gcc -S main.c-to get assembler code
	• Gcc --- save-temps : to get intermediatory files

Make: 
	• GNU Make utility to maintain groups of programs

-> to avoid re declaration we can keep #ifndef name
-> declaring function prototypes or prototyping of functions:
Int add (int,int)
->In one statement to reach the source file : cd/src
->Double quoted header files search for header files which is defined in it.( current directory)
->Angular header files checks in currrent directory also in gcc.

-> gcc -c ./src/calc.c
gcc -c ./src/calc.c -I./inc - to go parent directory

-> fatal error:calc.h: No such file or directory
 gcc -c ./src/calc.c -I./inc -o ./obj/calc.o- 
 Make: move the root directory to defined directory

	• Created directory structure
	• Cd mainprj
	• Mainprj>( create sub directories) mkdir inc obj scripts lib src bin
	• Created header file(with vi editor)
	• Before that 
	• Cd inc
	• Mainprj/inc>vi calc.h
	• Cd ../ or cd src (we can move to source file)
	• mainPrj/src/> vi calc.c
	• mainPrj/src/> vi main.c
	• Coming back to main directory - cd../
	• mainPrj/>gcc -c ./src/calc.c -I./inc/ -o ./obj/calc.o (convert to object file)
	• gcc -c ./src/main.c -I./inc/ -o ./obj/main.o
	• Tree
	• Vi Git ignore is for ignoring files or folders which is dfined in git ignore file to be upload on cloud platform.
