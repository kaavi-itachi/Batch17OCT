Else-IF ladder


	1. Else if ladder: It will test all the test cases until it match the test case.
	2. It will be helpful in non-numeric constants to be tested.
	3. Switch case: nt In condition only integers and ascii characters should be kept.
	• Process exited normally- whatever allocation has taken place has no bugs in gdb.
	• Default can be kept at starting of the switch condition but keeping break is mandatory.
	• Else if ladder we can have duplicate test cases.
	4. Looping:  1. Initialising variables 2. cond check 3.stats to be executed 4.counter
	5. There are three types : 1. do while 2. while 3. for
	6. Two types of loops : 1. entry controlled 2. exit controlled
	
Do{
}while(cond);
Why there is a semicolon at the end of do-while ?

While & for 
Why for?
We can intialise more than one variable, counters can be more than one (while running parallely)
More than one condition checking
We can ommit one or more sections.

For Loop is a entry based loop . Convert it to the exit controllable based loop.(ask Pras)
